Hi, my name is Vladimir Kuznichenkov. I am a Senior Infrastructure Engineer.
This blog is my attempt to synthesize and share what I’ve learned along the way.
Mainly, I'll share blog posts related to Infrastructure, Firmware, and Hardware.

Although I have a degree in Medical Engineering, I wasn't able to pursue that career path.
Instead, I started as a hardware developer, later transitioning to a software developer,
and now, I'm an infrastructure engineer.

My main project for the past two years has been the [HDO platform](https://hdo.ee), which aims to solve
the seemingly unsolvable problem of hiring the right engineers. The project began in my kitchen back in 2021
when we were discussing the tools we could use to optimize the time I spent on interviews.

I will share the story of this project in one of my upcoming blog posts. Stay tuned!
